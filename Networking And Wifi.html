<p>A University requires a ubiquitous wireless coverage across the campus. First, we survey and then do
     a comparative analysis of the survey to deploy the Wi-Fi network most appropriate for increased coverage,
      internet access and security requirements of a specific university.

Wi-Fi mesh systems also look nothing like a traditional setup with a router and range extender.
 The router and nodes use internal antennas and are almost always tastefully designed so you can place
  them out in the open rather than in a closet or under a desk. (Don't expect to find a lot of flashing 
  LED indicators—these systems are designed to blend in with your home's décor.) They usually have at least one
   LAN port for connecting to devices like TVs and gaming consoles,
 but USB connectivity is a rare feature at this point.</p>
